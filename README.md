# shop-ware

The test class shopWareLogin is built out using the TestNG framework.

The annotations are defined in reusableAnnotations, and also handles the WebDriver, ExtentReports, and ExtentTest declarations.

The reusableActions class is where the driver is defined, with options. This class is also where I created methods to perform the Selenium commands. These are then called upon in the test class, and passsed variables to keep the test class as streamlined as possible.

You can see the tests ran successfully in the html report Shop-Ware.html

This can be further improved by setting up the POM framework, to make it easily updateable and efficient.
